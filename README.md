# Gredy Kent Barbershop

**Description**

**Gredy-Kent Barbershop** is a Spanish booking app built for a small business in the Dominican Republic. The idea came from me to create an app that helps the owner organize appointments more easily for their clients. With this app, you can easily book your appointment, choose your favorite service, and pick the date and time that works best for youâ€”all from the convenience of your phone.
